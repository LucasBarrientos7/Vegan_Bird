A bird (from a planet where birds shoot through their mouths) must avoid obstacles to feed but only on vegetables.

Bird Actions:
Bird flight -> Only the directional key "up"
Shot -> space bar

Game rules:
- The bird only maintains its height in flight with the "up" key, otherwise it will hit the ground.
- The bird can shoot and turn hamburgers into vegetables.
- The more vegetables the bird eats, the more score it will get, if it eats hamburgers it will be deducted from the score.
